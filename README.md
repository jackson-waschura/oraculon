# oraculon
A toolkit for world building and preparing Dungeons &amp; Dragons games.

Oraculon is designed to help players and DMs create immersive and engaging fantasy worlds, populate them with interesting characters and creatures, and generate a wealth of backstory, lore, and flavor text to bring the game to life.

It uses the OpenAI API and custom prompts to generate a wiki of interconneceted pages which can then be used for session prep.

- Import existing notes and references from Obsidian
- Generate new pages based on existing pages such as NPCs, locations, items, monsters, and more
- Prepare for sessions by generating a session outline based on the current campaign state
- Present session outline using The Lazy Dungeon Master's system

## :world_map: Custom Worldbuilding Workflows

Here are some custom worldbuilding workflows that can be used to build out a homebrew campaign setting and prepare for sessions.

### :newspaper: Creating a new page

Creating a new page involves identifying the type of page you want to create, a short description of the page, and any additional context you want to provide. This additional context can include existing pages that are related to the page you want to create, or any other information you want to include.

The AI will then generate a new page based on the information you provided and present this first draft to you.

You can then review the page and make any necessary edits. Finally, once you are satisfied with the page, you can approve it and the AI will save the page to the wiki.

### :pencil: Editing an existing page

Editing an existing page involves identifying the specific page you want to edit, describing the changes you want to make, and any additional context you want to provide. This additional context can include existing pages that are related to the page you want to edit, or any other information you want to include.

The AI will then generate a new version of the page based on the information you provided and present this first draft to you.

You can then review the new version of the page and make any necessary edits. Finally, once you are satisfied with the page, you can approve it and the AI will save the page to the wiki.

### :detective: Finding and fixing inconsistencies

Finding and fixing inconsistencies involves identifying the specific page or pages that are inconsistent, describing the nature of the inconsistencies you want to fix, and any additional context you want to provide. This additional context can include existing pages that are related to the pages you want to fix, or any other information you want to include.

The AI will then generate a new version of the session outline based on the information you provided and present this to you.
