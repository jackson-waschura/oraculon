# oraculon
A toolkit for world building and preparing Dungeons &amp; Dragons games.

Oraculon is designed to help players and DMs create immersive and engaging fantasy worlds, populate them with interesting characters and creatures, and generate a wealth of backstory, lore, and flavor text to bring the game to life.

It uses the OpenAI API and custom prompts to generate a wiki of interconneceted pages which can then be used for session prep.

## Planned Features

- Import existing notes and references from Obsidian
- Generate new pages based on existing pages such as NPCs, locations, items, monsters, and more
- Prepare for sessions by generating a session outline based on the current campaign state
- Present session outline using The Lazy Dungeon Master's system
